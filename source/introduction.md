For years, the CentOS project was mainly busy rebuilding the Red Hat Entreprise
Linux distribution. However, the focus has now changed a bit. While the CentOS
distribution is still at the heart of the project, it is now a complete platform
with multiple subproject.

## What is a SIG?

> *Special Interest Groups (SIG) are smaller groups within the CentOS community
> that focus on a small set of issues, in order to either create awareness or to
> focus on development along a specific topic.*

SIG are the way the CentOS community organises itself; every SIG is made out
of several people, and has its own goals. There are Technical and Non-Technical
SIG.

## What is Config Management?

When we speak about Config Management, we mean actually a bit more. We mean:
configuration management, system lifecycle management and orchestration tools.
It it the tools that allows you to efficiently deploy and manage your machines,
nodes, vm, containers..

## What is the Config Management SIG?

A group of people who work together to bring those tools to the CentOS Users.
